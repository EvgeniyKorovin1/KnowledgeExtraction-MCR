# KnowledgeExtraction-MCR
This project demonstrates different approaches to the problem of supporting physician decision-making in diagnosing bronchopulmonary diseases. We are talking about different ways for a specialist to obtain additional information to increase confidence in the medical decisions made. The options presented here are what was developed by me in [the grant of the Russian Science Foundation](https://rscf.ru/project/22-19-00471/) and approved for public distribution by the management of this grant.

## Using
The experiments were conducted using the Google Colaboratory cloud platform. To reproduce the results, you need to sequentially run the code blocks in the notebook. It is worth noting that to use the program, you will need your own dataset that suits its specifics, since the dataset used in the experiment is protected by a commercial secret and is available for free distribution. To create your own dataset, you can use examples from notebooks with code that describe the structure of the desired data, allowing you to reproduce it.

## Documentation
The main documentation for the project is divided into parts, each of which will be described below.

* The code was documented directly in the notebooks with it, so you can freely familiarize yourself with it and use it for your own purposes in the future, within the limits permitted by the project license.
* The theoretical basis and scientific presentation associated with the project materials is available in the form of a scientific article in the report tab - [Related scientific research.pdf](https://github.com/EvgeniyKorovin1/KnowledgeExtraction-MCR/blob/main/Report/Related%20scientific%20research.pdf).
* Part of the documentation related to the integration and operation of the developed algorithms, as well as information about the data used, is protected by commercial secrets and is not available.
